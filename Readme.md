# Division Program

## Description

This Python script performs the division of three numbers and prints the result.

## Code

```python
Number1 = 93
Number2 = 43
Number3 = 21
Result = Number1 / Number2 / Number3
print("Result of Division of", Number1, "and", Number2, "and", Number3, "is", Result)
```

## Steps

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Initialize three variables `Number1`, `Number2`, and `Number3` with the values 93, 43, and 21, respectively.

2. **Calculate Division:**
   - Compute the result of dividing `Number1` by `Number2`, and then divide that result by `Number3`. Store the final result in the `Result` variable.

3. **Print Result:**
   - Print the result of the division operation in a formatted message to the console.
